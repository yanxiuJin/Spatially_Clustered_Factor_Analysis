# Spatially_Clustered_Factor_Analysis (SCFA)

This repository contains the implementation of Spatially Clustered Factor Analysis (SCFA), a method used to detect potential dependencies in multivariate spatial data, assuming the spatial locations are divided into clusters with the same dependence structures. The method iteratively detects these clusters and estimates the factor model for each cluster.
